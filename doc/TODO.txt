    SLight Project ToDo

=--= Future ideas:

[ ] If an User enters a page, that does not exist, and can create it, propose it to him :) Be User Friendly :)
[ ] In the 'Add content' chooser add the option "as sibling", that will add new content to the same parent.
[ ] Set-up CIS
[ ]     Track/test commits
[ ]     Run coverage test / report
[ ] Detect and report, if DB is non writable
[ ] Fix CMS::SpecField form (should contain checkboxes for 'Use...' so User can do the choice directly from Field form)
[ ] SLight::Handler::Browser
[ ]     SLight::Handler::Browser::Recent (list sub-pages in order in which they ware created - newer on top)
[ ]     SLight::Handler::Browser::Ordered (list sub-pages in order defined by 'order_by')
[ ] ContentSpec fields describing how to sort, what to put into title, menu, path, and so on, should be a templates, so that User can join fields, eg: '%hip%-%ID%'
[ ] Identify web robots. Use this information when performing authorization (add 'Robot' User type)
[ ] Switch to SQL::Abstract-like module (possibly deprecate SLight::Core::SQL)
[ ] Possibly rename Handler::User::Avatar to Handler::Core::Avatar
[ ] Ability to 'tag' objects with "permanent ID" - so an add-on can store it's config as an object.

[ ]     http://slight.notebook/_CMS_Spec/Field/1/Title/ is missing crumbs :(
[ ]     Adding first page is ultimately br0ken - root page MUST be created, before any sub-pages are created! (maybe even trough content.sql?)

=--= Sprint .. - ....-..-..

[ ]         Fetch only data from the given window.
[ ]     API::Page
[ ]         Ability to return owning_module and ID of main content element, so it's dead-simple to evaluate if Use has permissions to it.
[ ]     Drop 'order_by' and 'use_as_*' from 'Content_Spec' and related stuff. Fields in Entries will remain, so their content can be copied.
