Entities:

    Account
        Represents, describes and identifies site's User.

    Page
        Page must have at least one object attached to it (the 'main' object)
        Page defines what template is used to show it.
        Pages form a tree-like structure.

    Object
        Can be attached to Pages.
        Objects can have references between them. They will block deletion of an object, that is referred by others.
        For example:
            CMS::Proxy will refer to CMS::Entry, that it is pointing to.
            Shop::Product will refer to Shop::Category, in which it was put into.
        Objects can define (can be built-in or configurable), what other objects can become their children,
        and what Objects can be their parents (where they can be put).

    Object Specs
        Provide most basic description of objects.

    Asset
        Can be attached to: Site, Page, Object or Comment.
        Can refer to the entity as a whole, or just to one of it's fields.
        Many assets can be attached to entity, but only one asset can be attached to one entity/field combination.

    Comment
        Can be attached to: Page, Object, Asset or Comment.

    Tag
        Can be attached to: Page, Object, Comment or Asset.

Requirements/limitations:

 o Single entity can be attached only to one other entity.
